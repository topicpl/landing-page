    Q: "Are there any similar platforms?",
    A:
      "Not really, Omegle offers categories to be included but it’s optional and it’s not specific enough to work as intended, people can call the same thing in a few different ways. The next point worth mentioning is that there is no platform that combines categories with group chat. We are for now one of a kind.",

    Q: "What’s the monetization plan?",
    A:
      "We are planning on creating two branches of monetization flows. First one is simply an advertisement that will be non-invasive for the user. The second one is a subscription plan for premium accounts. These accounts will have more features than people using the platform without them. There accounts would be for sure very interesting for users who are streamers and celebrities that want to have a chat with their fans.",
